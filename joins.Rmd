## Introduction 

This notebook describes the process of joing data frames which is an important skill to have. It's very useful to know how to **merge** or **join** the data frames. R has a command called **merge** which can handle some of these tasks but if you look in the help pages for this command it will in turn make references to "join operations" which is a more general way to describe mering activity. In reality joining tables is quite common in SQL (Structured Query Language) so developing facility with this is a general skill that will pay dividends in the future. Let's start with a very basic example. The data is simple so you can focus on the "joining" activities.


```{r}

inventory <- data.frame(part_num=c("001","002","003"),
                    description=c("Indispensable Widget",
                                  "Flux Capacitor",
                                  "Radiator"),
                    price=c(20,25,15),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
                    
sales <- data.frame(part_num=c("001","001","001","003","110"),
                    quantity_sold=c(23,100,44,98,98),
                    sales_regions=c("east","west","north","north","south"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
inventory

sales
```


## Using keys

When we talk about joining or merging data frames we make reference to **keys** which are column names that two or more data frames have in common. This gives us a basis or reference point by which to combine the two data frames.

So what we have here is an invetnory data frame that lists part numbers, their descriptions, and current quantity in inventory. Basically, one line for each part. The second data frame, sales, represents the sales of various parts within one or more regions. Notice that no quantity of part 2 was sold at all. Notice also that 3 units of part number 1 were sold in three regions. The desire here is to *merge* or *join* these two data frames in various ways. Let's explore these. 

So the **part_num** column in each data frame appears to relate to the same thing so this will be our **key** by which to merge the two data sources. 

To visualize what various joins look like here is a diagram from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## full_join()

Let's start with a **full_join** which will seek to involve all rows in both data frames based on a matching **key** which, in this case, is the **part_num** column. 

## Assignment

Let's motivate this with an assignment. Use the two data frames above along with a join command to create a single table that contains a sales report for **all** part numbers even if there were no sales of that part number or it is not in the current inventory. Here is what we want:

```{r}
full_join(inventory,sales)
```

The **full_join** function can get us there. It will result in a table that includes all matched records from both the data frames and supply NA values for missing matches on either side. What does "matched records" mean ? 

```{r}
full_join(inventory,sales)
```

![](./PICS/salesmatch1.png)


Notice we see part number 002 even though there were no sales - but that's okay. The report requires sales figures for all parts. We also see a row for part 110 even though it doesn't appear in the inventory. Notice that there are missing values. The reason we get a value of NA for **description** and **price** in the 6th row is that part number 110 does not exist within the **inventory** data frame. So, to reasonably include the information in the fully joined data, the NAs must be provided as placeholders for the missing values. Also notice that there are missing values for the quantity and sales_regions realtive to part number 002 since it doesn't appear within the sales data frame. 

## inner_join()

Create a merged or joined table that shows **only** information for parts listed in inventory and only those parts that had at least one transaction. In effect we want only rows that are in common (based on the part_num key) to both data frames. 

The  **inner_join** which will produce a data frame that includes rows pertaining to part numbers *in common* to both data frames. An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal. 

```{r}
inner_join(inventory,sales)
```

This would mean then that the row in the sales data frame that refers to a part number of 110 would be omitted in the result since it does not occur in the inventory data frame. Part number 002 does not appear in the sales data frame so it is not listed here. 

## left_join()

Next up we have the **left_join** which will "favor" the first data frame referenced in the command in that it will include rows from inventory AND rows from **sales** where the **part_num** matches. So part number 002 is still included even though it does not appear in the **sales** data frame. 

```{r}
left_join(inventory,sales)
```

## right_join()

The right_join() will favor the second specified data frame which it will return all the rows from sales and rows from sales where the part number matches. This is why we get a line in the result for part 110 that includes missing values for description and price since those values are missing the inventory data frame. 

```{r}
right_join(inventory,sales)
```
